# ACM SP20 Front End Assessment

This is the Front End Assessment for Spring 2020 ACM Developer elections! We provide you a boilerplate to fill in and we will be assessing your ability to write React code, handle state, use react-router, amongst other things.

You will need to finish this by the **morning of your interview date**. Look at the following tasks for what to do! Good luck!

## Tasks
1. Clone this repository to your own **PRIVATE** repo, edit your repo.
2. Create a login page with a fake form to login with a email and a password. Upon logging in, the email state should be saved and the user should be redirected to the root url: `localhost:3000/` (or any other port)
3. Edit the home page to retrieve the user state and display it in any way you want. Let your creativity run free!!!
4. The home page should also be accessible by logged in users. If a user is not logged in, display an error and return the user to the login page.
5. Invite the following github users to your repo: StoneT2000, stanleylee, paulpan05, sumeet-bansal, annsudhart (sorry for the long list)
6. You will need to finish this by the **morning of your interview date**
